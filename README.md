XYZ-Sketch : Time and Space Near-optimal Set Reconciliation

The minisketch occupies excessive storage space, and since it is already available at <https://github.com/bitcoin-core/minisketch>, we do not included its files in our repository.

For PolyFast and XYZ-Sketch, simply compiling the corresponding `sample.cpp` file in the respective directory is sufficient to run them.
Additionally, `sample.cpp` provides a reference of their usage.
